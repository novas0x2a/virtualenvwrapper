 virtualenvwrapper 3.0
========================

What is virtualenvwrapper
=========================

virtualenvwrapper_ is a set of extensions to Ian Bicking's virtualenv_
tool.  The extensions include wrappers for creating and deleting
virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow,
making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without
introducing conflicts in their dependencies.

What's New in 3.0
=================

- Add Python 3 support, thanks in large part to the efforts of Daniel
  Kraus. Tested under Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2.
