What is virtualenvwrapper
=========================

virtualenvwrapper_ is a set of extensions to Ian Bicking's virtualenv_
tool.  The extensions include wrappers for creating and deleting
virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow,
making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without
introducing conflicts in their dependencies.

What's New in 3.1
=================

- Fix a problem with activation hooks when associating a new
  virtualenv with an existing project directory.
- Fix a problem with ``add2virtualenv`` and paths containing "special"
  characters such as ``&``.
