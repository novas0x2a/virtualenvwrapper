What is virtualenvwrapper
=========================

virtualenvwrapper_ is a set of extensions to Ian Bicking's virtualenv_
tool.  The extensions include wrappers for creating and deleting
virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow,
making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without
introducing conflicts in their dependencies.

What's New in 2.11.1
====================

- Fixes a bug with tab completion in sub-shell environments such as
  screen and tmux introduced in 2.11.
