What is virtualenvwrapper
=========================

virtualenvwrapper_ is a set of extensions to Ian Bicking's virtualenv_
tool.  The extensions include wrappers for creating and deleting
virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow,
making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without
introducing conflicts in their dependencies.

What's New in 3.0.1
===================

- Fix some packaging issues that made it more difficult to run the
  tests directly from the sdist package.
