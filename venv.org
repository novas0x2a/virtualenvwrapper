# Org-mode notes and task list

* TODO convert to distribute for packaging
  - get rid of newvenvw and virtualenvwrapper virtualenvs and re-create

* plugin system for hooks
  - http://bitbucket.org/dhellmann/virtualenvwrapper/issue/28/
  - use Distribute/setuptools entry points
  - namespace package `virtualenvwrapper` to hold plugins I write, but
    not required for other authors

** TODO how to specify execution order between plugin providers?
    - plugins could provide a "phase" function for sorting
      - return an integer, let the plugin author community sort out the
        ranges
    - alphabetical by plugin name
    - undefined

** TODO "user script" plugin implementation
    - uses pkg_resources to get contents of hook scripts out of
      python package and run them
    - move all/most existing hook execution here
    - handles both global & local hooks

** TODO cli app to run the hooks

** TODO how does cli app handle the "sourced" hook scripts
    - ability to `cd` into a specific directory, for example
    - separate plugin points for "foo_run_hook" and
      "foo_source_hook", handled differently by the calling script
      - run hooks are executed first (implement in any language)
      - source hooks are dumped to text files and then sourced
        (implement in shell language)

** TODO expose each hook point as an entry point function
  - [ ] requirements
    - automatically install packages based on requirements file
      given to pip
    - separate hook, or let a package just use postmkvirtualenv?
